# Important Notes from Zero 2 Prod Book

---

## Inner Development Loop

---

- `cargo watch -x run` : This command will watch for changes in the code and automatically re-run the application whenever a change is detected. This allows for a faster development cycle, as you don't have to manually stop and start the application every time you make a change.
- **Command Chaining**: You can chain multiple commands together like

```sh
cargo watch -x check -x test -x run
```

This will run `cargo check`, `cargo test`, and `cargo run` in sequence whenever a change is detected. This is useful for ensuring that your code compiles and passes tests before running the application. Our inner development loop right here.

## Code Coverage with `cargo-llvm-cov`

---

`cargo-llvm-cov` is a tool that provides code coverage information for Rust projects. It uses LLVM's coverage instrumentation to generate reports on which lines of code were executed during tests.
To use `cargo-llvm-cov`, you can install it using Cargo:

```sh
rustup component add llvm-tools-preview
cargo install cargo-llvm-cov
```

---

## Security Vulnerabilities check with `cargo-audit`

---

`cargo-audit` is a tool that checks for security vulnerabilities in Rust dependencies. It uses the RustSec Advisory Database to identify known vulnerabilities in the crates you are using.
To use `cargo-audit`, you can install it using Cargo:

```sh
cargo install cargo-audit
```

Once installed, you can run it in your project directory to check for vulnerabilities:

```sh
cargo audit
```

This will scan your `Cargo.toml` and `Cargo.lock` files for dependencies and report any known vulnerabilities, along with their severity and any available fixes.

## Project Scope

---

We will fulfill two user stories in this project:

- As a blog visitor,
  I want to subscribe to the newsletter,
  So that I can receive email updates when new content is published on the blog.

- As the blog author,
  I want to send an email to all my subscribers,
  So that I can notify them when new content is published on the blog.

We will not add features to

- unsubscribe from the newsletter;
- manage multiple newsletters;
- segment subscribers in multiple audiences;
- track opening and click rates of the emails;

## Seeing macros in action with `cargo expand`

---

`cargo expand` is a tool that allows you to see the expanded code generated by Rust macros. This is particularly useful for understanding how macros work and for debugging macro-related issues.
To use `cargo expand`, you can install it using Cargo:

```sh
cargo install cargo-expand
```

You can then run it in your project directory to see the expanded code for a specific item:

```sh
cargo expand --lib
```
